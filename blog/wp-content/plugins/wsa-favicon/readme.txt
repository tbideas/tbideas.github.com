Easily upload your favicon and convert regular images to favicons

== Description ==

Favicons are small icons that represent your website. They usually appear next to 
your website's URL in the navigation bar, in the tab, or next to the bookmark for
your site depending on the browser. Using a favicon can boast your website's 
credability to your visitors.

WSA Favicon makes uploading a favicon a simple process. Most favicon plugins require 
you to generate your favicon in the correct ICO format on a thrid party site. WSA
Favicon will automatically convert PNG, GIF, and JPEG images to a multi-resolution
ICO format.

Using a multi-resolution format ICO for your favicon will mean that when your favicon
is resized it will continue to look great! This is acheived by embedding multiple 
images of various resolutions within one ICO.

After converting your image file to the right format and dimensions, WSA Favicon will
attach your favicon to each webpage so it displays in your users URL or tab and next
to each bookmark.

WSA Favicon can also upload, convert, and display icons for Apple touch devices 
including the iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch. Without using this plugin if your users
bookmark your website or blog on their touch device it will take a screenshot of part
of your webpage but with WSA Favicon you can enhance the icon's display for your 
visitors.

WSA Favicon will use Imagick for imaging formating if available and fallback to GD,
which is installed with PHP by default.
