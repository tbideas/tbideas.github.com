I wanted to share with you with beautiful article sent by a friend of our project. This is exactly the vision we had when we started the project.

Click on the image below to get the full article in PDF.

The text is in french but the english translation is included (in the lower left part). I will add the exact source as soon as I get it from our friend.

_So if you are travelling this summer, do not forget to capture the colors of your vacations because you will soon be able to reproduce them at home!_

**Many of you have sent us links to lamps, other projects, articles on lights, etc. We do not relay everything but please continue! We love it! You can also post them directly on our facebook page.**
