Loochi's campaign ended yesterday night at midnight. We sent a big thank you to all our backers, you can [read it here](http://us5.campaign-archive1.com/?u=1479e36c3eaab935c86521be7&id=c0758870bf&e=4b5612d1f4).

Of course we have known for a while that without a miracle we would not be able to make it and we started to look at 2013 with brand new eyes. We met in late december to set a few principles for 2013. Here they are.

### Share our progress more often

Feedback from you is what keeps us moving. We have found that the most productive and great times of 2012 happened when we shared our progress with you and you sent feedbacks.

Every month we will prepare a video to show you the current status of our prototypes. You will see what we have been working on and we look forward to your comments.

For those of you familiar with Agile methodologies, those videos will be our "demo-days" at the end of our sprints: we are experimenting with agile principles in a hardware startup.

### More prototypes in the hands of our users

The most frustrating thing about an unfinished crowdfunding project is not that we dont receive the money but that you will never receive the product. After spending half a year in research and development we were really looking forward to seeing you use our products.

In 2013 we want to put our prototypes in your hands and see you use them.

Every time we have a stable prototype, we will offer a few to our fans. They might be free (first-come first-served) or at-cost (you pay for the parts and shipping). They will be assembled and tested before we ship them but if you are interested we might also send you kits. Of course they will not be complete products: you will most likely get only the electronic and will have to be a little creative to turn that into a full-featured product!

### Write more

We learnt so much in 2012 that I litteraly have dozens of small blog posts that I started but did not finish last year. We want to share more of what we do with you. Expect more on the blog in 2013.

Our main themes are and will remain:
- Starting an hardware startup
- Electronic Engineering for connected devices

Every post will be published on our [facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/tbideas/) and [twitter feed](http://www.twitter.com/tb_ideas). You know what to do ;)

### Final note

Starting TBIdeas and Loochi has been an incredible experience on many levels. We have met awesome people, pushed the limits of our engineering and marketing skills and met a few bumps on the road that remind us that entrepreneurship is all about bouncing back quickly.

We would like to thank you all very much for your support in 2012 and wish you a great and happy 2013!
