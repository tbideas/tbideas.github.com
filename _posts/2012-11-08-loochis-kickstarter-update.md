Following our project post for 1st of November, we finally heard back from Kickstarter! As they come with a bunch of questions about the product and we expect to receive next week whole 3D-printed elements to assemble a complete prototype, we have decided to take the time to build it before asking them to validate the project again in 2-4 weeks. We are sorry about such delay, but be sure it will allow us to propose you an even better Loochi ;)

And we plan a few cool updates in the next days ;) Stay tuned!
