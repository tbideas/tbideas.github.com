description: Elektor just released a pretty nice poster for the Raspberry Pi
---

Elektor just sent out its [weekly newsletter: Elektor.POST][elektor-newsletter] (highly recommended) and this week they are giving away a very nice RaspberryPi poster.

[![Elektor RaspberryPi poster](/blog/img/elektor-raspberry-pi-poster.jpg)](elektor-poster)

You can download it [here][elektor-poster]

I thought I would point this out because it's one of the great things Elektor has been doing as part of their new online strategy: Magazines need to adapt to survive and I think they are doing a pretty good job. 

I still think access to their forums should be free but at least they are trying something new and different. Big up to them!

**Disclaimer:** I have been an avid reader of elektor for as long as I can remember (my dad has always been a subscriber) - and I have learnt a lot thanks to them! **But** TBideas is not affiliated with them in any way ;)
