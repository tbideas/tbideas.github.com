description: On december 4th we launched our first Indiegogo campaign for Loochi, our open-source Bluetooth 4 lamp. In this post we would like to share all the data we collected in a month to give you an idea of what to expect, metrics to compare to and a few lessons learnt on the way.

Thomas discusses the end of the crowdfunding campaign of Loochi and the new prototypes that TBideas is giving away for free. 

He also shows the first draft of the next project: an arduino compatible, wifi enabled, high power led driver. Boris jumps in and demonstrates how to track the International Space Station with it!
